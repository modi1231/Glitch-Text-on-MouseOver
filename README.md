# Glitch-Text-on-MouseOver
Using JavaScript this shows how to scramble an element's text for a short period of time.. like it was 'glitching'.  

It was a pretty straight forward application of some jquery to get the text, get a random number from 1 to max length of the text, replace it with a randomly picked character from an array, and use it all in a timed looped function.
